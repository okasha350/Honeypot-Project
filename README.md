## 🎯 Overview

### Project Summary

The **Honeypot System Project** aims to build an isolated virtual environment that simulates real servers to attract and record malicious activity. Captured attacks are analyzed to provide actionable insights for improving cybersecurity posture without risking production systems. The methodology includes deploying honeypots and monitoring VMs, collecting and analyzing logs, and producing dashboards, reports, and thorough documentation.

### Problem

Production networks and servers are subject to daily attack attempts (web app exploits, malware delivery, SSH brute force, etc.). Observing and analyzing these attacks directly on production systems is risky and impractical.

### Solution

Deploy an isolated honeypot environment using virtual machines (VMs) running test services and specialized logging tools. The honeypot captures attacker behavior and forwards telemetry securely to a centralized monitoring VM for analysis. Alerts, dashboards, and reports help detect threats and recommend security hardening steps. All testing is performed in a controlled, isolated environment.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system consists of four virtual machines operating on an isolated network (VMnet2) to simulate a realistic production environment.

| Component | OS | IP Address | Role |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| **Honeypot VM** | Ubuntu 22.04 | `192.168.100.10` | Hosts honeypots (Cowrie, Dionaea) and captures malicious traffic. |
| **Monitoring VM** | Ubuntu 22.04 | `192.168.100.20` | Central log collection (syslog-ng), analysis, and evidence management. |
| **Sandbox VM** | Ubuntu 22.04 | `192.168.100.30` | Isolated environment for malware analysis. |
| **Attacker VM** | Kali Linux | `192.168.100.50` | Attack simulation and targeted testing. |

## 🚀 Configuration & Usage

### 1. Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/honeypot-system.git
cd honeypot-system
```

### 2. Deployment
Follow the detailed instructions in the `docs/` folder to configure the VMs and deploy services.

| Week | Docs File | Task |
|---:|---|---|
| **2** | `docs/week2-setup.md` | Set up the isolated network and assign static IPs. |
| **3** | `docs/week3-setup.md` | Deploy Cowrie and Dionaea, and configure syslog-ng. |
| **4** | `docs/week4-setup.md` | Prepare the Sandbox and evidence management procedures. |

### 3. Monitoring Scripts
Use the following scripts on the **Monitoring VM** after the environment is configured:

| Script | Description | Run command |
|---|---|---:|
| `full-system-check.sh` | Comprehensive check of all system components (network, services, logs). | `./scripts/full-system-check.sh` |
| `monitor-logs.sh` | Produce attack statistics (SSH/FTP attempts, top attacking IP addresses). | `./scripts/monitor-logs.sh` |
| `document-sample.sh` | Start documenting a new piece of evidence (chain-of-custody). | `./scripts/document-sample.sh` |
| `transfer-to-sandbox.sh` | Securely transfer a documented sample to the Sandbox VM. | `./scripts/transfer-to-sandbox.sh` |

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **Strict network isolation:** Keep all VMs on a private virtual network (VMnet2) with no direct Internet or host network access except for necessary initial updates.
- **Evidence management:** Maintain accurate chain-of-custody records for each collected sample and verify integrity using cryptographic hashes.
- **Isolated analysis:** Never execute collected malware outside the dedicated Sandbox environment.
- **Snapshots:** Take VM snapshots before major changes or after each key milestone.
